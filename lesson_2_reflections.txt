1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
--- Initializing a repository will create a .git metadata file that will then track all changes made to that repository. You need to do this so that you can use all the tools available to you in git and track the changes in your repository. 

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
--- The staging area allows you to control exactly which files are committed to the repository that are in your working directory. It does not necessariy contain all the files in your working directory, and lets you have more control over the commits made to your git repository.
